# project_box

Basic of this project is to give the user possibility to add "directories" and web pages to these directories.
Actually, the add directory is just not working, but then when it'll all work together, you could have the project box open to whatever project you choose and then close it and change to whatever other project. Hope to get some feedback, felixocl@gmail.com

This project has it's connect and php files into the php directory. Have teste if the connect works... but it's supposed to work. But something goes wrong with that between jquery and php files.

All my JQuery functions are inside my index.php.

any help or comment would be apreciated.
